#   ./build.sh           build, check, print the sha256 and write it to WASM_SHA256
#   ./build.sh --check   build, check, and compare the sha256 with WASM_SHA256 (exit 3 if it differs)
#
# Runs `cargo near build non-reproducible-wasm --locked` with `--remap-path-prefix` for the cargo home,
# the rustup home, the repository and the target directory, so panic messages in the wasm carry neutral
# paths (/cargo/registry/..., /lantern-row/...) instead of machine-specific ones. cargo-near takes
# RUSTFLAGS only through `--env` and appends `--cfg near` itself, so RUSTFLAGS and
# CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS are unset here (the latter would make cargo drop `--cfg near`).
# It also pins the host triple that cargo hashes (see "Host pin" below); it sets RUSTC_WRAPPER for
# that and replaces any wrapper set before. It unsets every CARGO_NEAR_* and NEP330_* variable
# (see "cargo-near's own variables" below).
#
# The build fails if `strings` finds /Users/, /home/ or the current user name in the wasm.
# Output: $CARGO_TARGET_DIR/near/lantern_row.wasm (default target/near/lantern_row.wasm).
# Needs: cargo-near 0.22, the toolchain pinned in rust-toolchain.toml, strings, sha256sum or shasum.
